/**
 * When items are moved around by a creative mode player, the client just tells the server to set a stack to a specific item.
 * This means that if the client thinks it's holding a stick, it will instruct the server to set the slot to a stick.
 * Even if the stick is supposed to represent another item.
 * <p>
 * My hacky solution:
 * When a packet is sent to void a slot. The item previously in there gets set in "polyMCrecentlyVoided".
 * Then when it tries to set a slot to an item. It first gets checked to see if the item it tries to set could be the poly of
 * We also check if the client tries to set a slot to its polyd version.
