     * PolyMc wants to have a reference to the player whilst we serialize the palette so we can account for per player polymaps.
     * Normally we use Nucleoid's packet tweaker library which puts the player into a static variable right before writing.
     * But as things are being done in constructors here, before the packet reaches that method, that won't work. Therefore, we instead place a reference to the player right here, inside the method that the packet is being constructed in.
